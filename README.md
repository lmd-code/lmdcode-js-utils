# LMD-Code JS Utils

Small, self-contained, reusable Javascript utilities.

## Utilities

All scripts in this repository were made for my own small projects where dependency on larger, more feature-rich, libraries would be overkill.

Feel free to use if you think they are helpful for your projects.

See the individual README files for more information and usage guidance.

### [LmdStorage](LmdStorage/README.md)

A lightweight wrapper for interacting with local storage (`localStorage`/`sessionStorage`).

### [LmdCookies](LmdCookies/README.md)

A lightweight wrapper for interacting with browser cookies.
