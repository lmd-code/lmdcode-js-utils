# LMD-Code JS Utils

Small, self-contained, reusable Javascript utilities.

## Utilities

All scripts in this repository were made for my own small projects where dependency on larger, more feature-rich, libraries would be overkill.

Feel free to use if you think they are helpful for your projects.

See the individual README files for more information and usage guidance.

### [LmdStorage](LmdStorage/README.md)

A lightweight browser storage (`localStorage`/`sessionStorage`) wrapper. Use a single storage item to store multiple values in key/value pairs, including arrays, plain objects and Map objects.

### [LmdCookies](LmdCookies/README.md)

A lightweight wrapper for browser cookies. Easily set/update, retrieve and delete cookies, configure cookie settings (path, domain, HTTPS only etc) globally or for individual cookies. Use a prefix to namespace cookies.
